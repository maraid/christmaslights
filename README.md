LED christmas lights control, with the ESP8266 board

The base of the project is from Tony D. from Adafruit and his Christmas lights project

Depending on the number and power consumption of the LEDs an amplifier should be used.
I used an NPN BD237 transistor in common emiter amplifier circuit for this purpose.
